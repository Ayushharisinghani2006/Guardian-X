# AI Protector Backend

## Introduction
The backend of **AI Protector** is built using **Java Spring Boot**. It powers the extension by handling AI-based phishing detection, content filtering logic, and user behavior analysis. The backend serves as the central hub for processing data and providing actionable insights to the frontend.

## Features
- **Phishing Detection API**: Uses AI models to detect phishing attempts and evaluate page safety.
- **Content Filtering Rules Engine**: Processes rules defined in `rules.json` to filter unsafe content dynamically.
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Analyzes browsing patterns and generates tailored safety warnings.

## Folder Structure

# Assets Folder

## Introduction
The `assets` folder contains important configuration files and AI models used by the **AI Protector** project. These files play a crucial role in enabling dynamic content filtering, phishing detection, and other AI-based functionalities.

## Files in the Assets Folder
### 1. **rules.json**
- **Purpose**: 
  Contains content filtering rules that define how potentially harmful or unwanted content should be handled.
- **Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "rules": [
      {
        "type": "block",
        "pattern": ".*phishing.*",
        "action": "block"
      },
      {
        "type": "alert",
        "pattern": ".*ads.*",
        "action": "warn"
      }
    ]
  }
Explanation:

type: Describes the type of rule (e.g., block, alert).
pattern: The regex pattern used to identify content.
action: Specifies what action to take (block, warn, etc.).
Usage: Modify this file to add or update rules for custom content filtering.

2. phishing_model.json
Purpose: A pre-trained AI model used for real-time phishing detection. The model analyzes URLs and webpage content to predict potential threats.

Structure:

json
Copy code
{
  "modelVersion": "1.0",
  "threshold": 0.8,
  "data": { ... }
}
Explanation:

modelVersion: Indicates the version of the phishing detection model.
threshold: The confidence level required to flag a site as phishing.
data: The serialized weights and structure of the AI model.
Usage: Replace or update this file when training a new phishing detection model.

Guidelines for Modifying Files
Backup: Always create a backup of existing files before making changes.
Editing rules.json:
Use a text editor or JSON editor to add new patterns or actions.
Validate the JSON format to avoid syntax errors.
Updating phishing_model.json:
Ensure the new model is compatible with the backend code and TensorFlow.js.
Update the modelVersion to track changes.
Future Additions
Include language-specific rules for multilingual content filtering.
Store user-specific customization files for personalized settings.
# Image Folder

## Introduction
The `image` folder contains all the visual assets used in the **AI Protector** project. These include icons, logos, and other graphical elements required for the Chrome extension interface and documentation.

## Files in the Image Folder

### 1. **icon.png**
- **Purpose**: 
  - Used as the Chrome extension icon.
  - Displayed in the Chrome toolbar and `chrome://extensions/` page.
- **Recommended Size**: 
  - 128x128 pixels (for optimal display across all platforms).
- **Usage**: 
  - Specified in `manifest.json` under the `icons` section:
    ```json
    "icons": {
      "16": "image/icon.png",
      "48": "image/icon.png",
      "128": "image/icon.png"
    }
    ```




## Guidelines for Adding New Images
1. **File Format**:
   - Use `.png` or `.svg` for high-quality and scalable images.
2. **Naming Convention**:
   - Use descriptive and consistent file names (e.g., `error_icon.png`, `info_icon.png`).
3. **Optimization**:
   - Compress images to reduce file size without compromising quality (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim).
4. **Size Recommendations**:
   - Follow Chrome's guidelines for extension assets:
     - Toolbar icons: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels.
     - Popup images: 256x256 pixels or scalable

# Frontend (UI) - AI Protector

## Introduction
The frontend of **AI Protector** is responsible for the user interface, including the popup window and interactions with the backend. The interface displays safety warnings, phishing alerts, content filtering messages, and provides the user with options to manage settings.

## Folder Structure
frontend/ ├── popup.js # Frontend logic for handling popup UI ├── popup.html # HTML structure for the popup window ├── content.js # Script for interacting with webpage content ├── style.css # Styles for the popup UI

markdown

## Key Components

### 1. **popup.js**
- **Purpose**: Handles the logic for displaying the popup interface.
- **Functions**:
  - Listens for user interactions (e.g., clicks, form submissions).
  - Fetches data from the backend (e.g., phishing detection results).
  - Dynamically updates the popup based on user settings and backend responses.

### 2. **popup.html**
- **Purpose**: Defines the structure of the popup interface.
- **Contains**:
  - Input fields for custom filtering rules.
  - Display sections for warnings and alerts.
  - Buttons for interacting with the backend (e.g., test phishing detection, enable/disable filtering).

### 3. **content.js**
- **Purpose**: Injected into web pages to interact with the content and communicate with the background script.
- **Functions**:
  - Monitors page content for phishing indicators.
  - Applies content filtering rules as defined by the user.
  - Provides real-time safety warnings and alerts.

## Styling
- The popup UI is styled using **style.css**.
- The design is simple, ensuring that the warnings and alerts are easy to read and understand.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayushharisinghani2006/AI-PROTECTOR-2024.git
   cd ai-protector/frontend
Load the extension in Chrome:
Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
Enable Developer mode.
Click Load unpacked and select the frontend folder.
Future Improvements
Enhance the UI for a better user experience (UX).
Add support for custom themes (e.g., light/dark mode).
Extend frontend features with more detailed safety insights.


## Backend Tests
The `backend_tests` folder contains unit tests for the Spring Boot backend. These tests ensure that the core APIs work as expected.

- **ContentFilterControllerTest.java**:
  - Tests the `/api/filter` endpoint for content filtering functionality.
  
- **BehaviourRequestTest.java**:
  - Tests the logic for user behavior analysis and safety warnings.

## Frontend Tests
The `frontend_tests` folder contains tests for the popup and content scripts.

- **popup.test.js**:
  - Tests interactions and UI updates in the popup (e.g., rule creation and backend responses).
  
- **content.test.js**:
  - Tests how `content.js` interacts with web pages (e.g., injecting content and applying filtering rules).

## Development Tools
The `dev_tools` folder includes utilities for simulating backend responses and testing with mock data.

- **test_data.json**: Contains sample inputs and expected outputs for AI models to validate their functionality.
- **mock_server.js**: A mock server for testing frontend-to-backend communication without needing a live backend.

## Running Tests
1. To run backend tests, use Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn test
2.For frontend tests, use a test runner like Jest:
bash
